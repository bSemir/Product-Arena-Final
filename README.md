This is a repository for a final practical task regarding internship at ***Tech387***.
#
We were told to make a small clone of Product Arena web app by analyzing its design and APIs.
#
For the Backend position, I had to make functional backend APIs and database, with some frontend.
Techonologies used:
- Python
- Flask
- Sqlite3
- HTML
- Bootstrap
#
Some disclaimers:
I didn't focus much on the frontend and perfect design as asked, and I think that I added more backend functionalities than we were asked. But, problem says
that we need to implement user login and validation, endpoint for "full stack dev part" which consists of explonations of things needed to learn for that role and
some additional links that lead to youtube videos.
# 
I've implemented:
- User registration
- User login
- All validation for two above
- User logout
- Simple endpoints to every course available on Product Arena, the design is just not the same.
#
Another important note is that I haven't focused much on good code, I have tried to make base HTML page and "extend" it for the upcoming ones, but some styling
didn't work and I had to move on and just finish the project.
